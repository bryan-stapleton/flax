# project flax

This is a project I made to make it easier to collect data from Twitter for the purpose of education in data analysis. I noticed a while back that data has recently become more and more expensive and harder to get ahold of, which made it difficult for me to get good datasets to practice on. This allows users to get real world data from Twitter without having to pay for an API key or wait for access to any of the alternative free sources. It's a completely free, open source service that is utilizes  Twint and NLTK3 to retrieve tweets by query and analyze tweet sentiment.
