# project _Flax

!! Heroku is discontinuing their free dynos so these links will break at some point in the near future. 

This application allows users to get real world data from Twitter without having to pay for an API key, dealing with rate limits, or having to wait for access to any of the alternative free sources. It's a completely free and open source service that is utilizes  Twint and NLTK3 to retrieve tweets by query and analyze tweet sentiment. Tweets can be downloaded from the upper right dropdown menu either in their entirety (all results) or from selected results. Tweets can be selected or deselected by double click.

See it in action at https://flax-app.herokuapp.com/app or explore the api at https://flax-app.herokuapp.com (Please note that the first startup can be slow if the dyno has gone idle. After it wakes up it will load quickly).
