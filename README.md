This is a project I made to make it easier to collect data from Twitter for the purpose of education in data analysis. This application allows users to get real world data from Twitter without having to pay for an API key, dealing with rate limits, or having to wait for access to any of the alternative free sources. It's a completely free and open source service that is utilizes  Twint and NLTK3 to retrieve tweets by query and analyze tweet sentiment. Tweets can be downloaded from the upper right dropdown menu either in their entirety (all results) or from selected results. Tweets can be selected or deselected by double click.
